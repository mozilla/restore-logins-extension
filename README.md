The “Password Protection” feature of AVG security software has caused logins and passwords stored in Firefox to disappear after recent updates to Firefox. AVG has since issued a fix for this issue. However, if you were impacted by this issue, a recovery method has been detailed in [this support article](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/passwords-disappearing-avg-security).

This extension will restore saved passwords and logins without the need to go through all of the steps. Ensure that your AVG Internet Security software is up to date, then install this extension. And your passwords will be recovered.
